                    <p>
                        Here's a short description of the scopes of <b>var</b>,
                        <b>let</b>, and <b>const</b> in JavaScript:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <ol

                    >
                        <li>
                            <b>var</b>: - var variables are function-scoped,
                            meaning they are accessible within the function they
                            are defined in. - If declared outside of any
                            function, they become global variables, accessible
                            throughout the entire script.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>let</b>: - let variables are block-scoped, making
                            them accessible within the block (e.g., within loops
                            or conditionals) in which they are defined. - They
                            are not accessible outside of the block in which
                            they are declared.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>const</b>: - Similar to let, const variables are
                            block-scoped. - Additionally, const variables are
                            immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed
                            once assigned, though it's essential to note that
                            for objects and arrays, the variable itself cannot
                            be reassigned, but the properties or elements within
                            them can be modified.

                        <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b> are two distinct values

                                    <b>Use Case</b>: Typically, null is
                                    explicitly assigned to a variable or
                                    property when you want to indicate that it
                                    has no value or is intentionally empty.
                                </li>

                                        <li>

                                            property to indicate an absence of a

                                    represents a variable or property that has

                                    value. It often indicates unintentional
                                    absence or missing values.

                                            by default.

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        A Representational State Transfer (<b>REST</b>) API is a
                        set of architectural constraints and principles for
                        designing networked applications. It is an approach to
                        building web services that are simple, scalable, and
                        stateless, making it easier for different systems to
                        communicate with each other over the internet. Key
                        characteristics of REST APIs include:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <ul style="list-style: disc" class="px-5 text-justify">
                        <li>
                            <b>Resources</b>: REST APIs model resources as
                            objects or data, which are identified by unique URLs
                            (Uniform Resource Locators). Resources can represent
                            entities like users, products, or any other data you
                            want to expose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Stateless</b>: Each request from a client to a
                            REST API must contain all the information needed to
                            understand and process the request. The server does
                            not store any client-specific information between
                            requests, making it easier to scale and maintain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>HTTP Methods</b>: REST APIs use standard HTTP
                            methods, such as GET (retrieve data), POST (create
                            data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data),
                            to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
                            operations on resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Representation</b>: Data is transferred between
                            the client and server in a common format, such as
                            JSON or XML. This allows different clients,
                            including web browsers and mobile apps, to
                            communicate with the API.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Statelessness</b>: REST APIs are stateless,
                            meaning each request from a client to the server
                            must contain all the information necessary for the
                            server to understand and process the request. The
                            server doesn't store any client-specific data
                            between requests, which makes it highly scalable and
                            maintainable.
                        </li>
